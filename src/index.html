                <h3>How is <b>this</b> site made?</h3>
                <p>The background you're seeing is made with WebGL2, not ThreeJS. Its really just one cube, but instanced multiple times with different matrices applied to each instance. And in reality, its actually just a bunch of triangles where the vertices are manipulated by multiplying a few matrices together.</p>
                <p>tldr; I do some math on 3D points and draw 2D triangles. Source: <a href="https://github.com/lord-xld3/webgl-2-background">trust me bro</a></p>

                    <p>The cow spins when you move your mouse or tap on the screen. This was my first project with WebGL and it works fine, but there's a lot that could be improved, like unnecessary code in the main rendering loop. Still pretty cool for my first WebGL project!</p>

                    <p>Tried to implement my own Mandelbrot set explorer with compute shaders, however:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>WebGPU isn't ready yet</li>
                        <li>Boundary tracing is an inherently serial workload, and GPUs are built for parallel workloads</li>
                        <li>Other sites exist that use fragment shaders for the same purpose</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due to these limitations, I've stopped working on it until we can finally use compute shaders on the web. There's a plethora of ways to optimize a Mandelbrot set, but they're not universally beneficial. Ideally, the CPU should predict which pixels actually need to be processed and hand that off to the GPU. Whether its symmetry, perodicity, or boundary tracing. In reality, a good GPU is so fast that it can render multiple frames per second.</p>
                    <p>It was still a cool project, and I learned things about complex numbers, iterators and collections in Rust, and NOT mutably borrowing within nested parallel iterators. Oh, I also made an unsafe function that mutates a raw pointer from a Vec and it worked, but it was slower.</p>

                    <img src="img/boundary_tracing.png" alt="Boundary tracing">
                    <p>This was one of my first real projects with Python. Its good for building a project quickly, but Python sucks man. Give me back my curly boys, get rid of the __init__ junk, and give me immutable types with static analysis. As for the actual boundary tracing logic? It works sometimes. I'm not going to elaborate further, there's plenty of papers on different algorithms for different shapes. My algorithm is not one of those, I just drew some pictures in ms paint and tried to figure it out.</p>

                    <p>So a buddy of mine has a Mazdaspeed3 and he likes to tinker with it. He got really annoyed with tuning, then test driving to generate some logs, then editing every column and row in his tune file, and repeating this to improve his vehicle's performance.</p>
                    <p>He wrote this Python program to fit a curve to his log data, make some corrections, and pump out a new CSV file that he can put into his tune. Wicked.</p>
                    <p>I was like "watch me re-write it in Rust with a GPU compute shader", and then <b>I did.</b></p>
                    <p>There was absolutely no good reason to optimize his program further with Rust and wgpu-rs. I just wanted an excuse to use a compute shader.</p>

                <h4>Some of them just hit all the requirements, some of them were way outside the scope of anything web-related (performing XOR operations on UTF-8 bytes for a password "encryptor")</h4>
